#  GODive ACTION ‚Äì GitHub Action for Docker Image Analysis

**Dive CI Analysis** is a GitHub Action that leverages the powerful [`dive`](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) tool to analyze Docker images directly in your CI/CD pipeline. It provides detailed insights into image structure, efficiency, wasted space, and can enforce automated quality gates to ensure your images remain lean and production-ready.

>  Ideal for teams optimizing Docker images, hardening security, or maintaining CI health.

---

## üìå Why Use This Action?

-  Enforces image **efficiency** and **layer quality** via thresholds
-  Generates **reports and summaries** to review in CI interface
-  Flexible config via `.dive-ci.yml` or **on-the-fly input params**
-  Automatically installs and runs the latest version of `dive`
-  Supports **CI fail-fast behavior** for bad images
-  Works out-of-the-box with any docker images

## üöÄ Quick Start

```yaml
name: Dive CI Image Analysis

on: [push]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Dive analyze
        uses: dzhunli/godive-action@v2.0.8
        with:
          image_name: my-image:latest
          lowestEfficiency: "0.85"
          highestWastedBytes: "15MB"
          highestUserWastedPercent: "0.2"
          summary: true
```

 `use_config`               | Use external `.dive-ci.yml` (`true`) or define thresholds inline (`false`) | ‚ùå No     | `false` 
 `ci_config`                | Path to `.dive-ci.yml` if `use_config` is `true`                           | ‚ùå No     | ‚Äî       
 `lowestEfficiency`         | Minimum acceptable efficiency (0.0‚Äì1.0)                                    | ‚ùå No  *  | ‚Äî       
 `highestWastedBytes`       | Maximum wasted space allowed (e.g. `10MB`, `500KB`)                        | ‚ùå No  *  | ‚Äî       
 `highestUserWastedPercent` | Max % of user layer waste (0.0‚Äì1.0)                                        | ‚ùå No  *  | ‚Äî       
 `allow_large_image`        | Set to `true` if the image is >1GB to bypass scanning                      | ‚ùå No     | `false` 
 `continue_on_fail`         | Continue the step with (zero exit code) even if thresholds fail            | ‚ùå No     | `true`  
 `report`                   | Generate `/tmp/DIVE_REPORT.md` markdown report                             | ‚ùå No     | `true`  
 `summary`                  | Append summary to the GitHub Actions UI summary tab                        | ‚ùå No     | `false` 

*  \* **Required only if use_config: false**

#### Example of a .dive-ci.yml file
```yaml
rules:
  # If the efficiency is measured below X%, mark as failed.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1.
  lowestEfficiency: 0.95

  # If the amount of wasted space is at least X or larger than X, mark as failed.
  # Expressed in B, KB, MB, and GB.
  highestWastedBytes: 20MB

  # If the amount of wasted space makes up for X% or more of the image, mark as failed.
  # Note: the base image layer is NOT included in the total image size.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1; fails if the threshold is met or crossed.
  highestUserWastedPercent: 0.20
```
